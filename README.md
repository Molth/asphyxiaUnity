This project is a native unmanaged reliable udp, based on enet, kcp and nanosockets. 

The fastest, most stable, and minimal memory consumption c# kcp implementation. 

This project provides support for peer-to-peer (P2P) connections and Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal. 
It enables direct communication between clients even when they are behind different NAT devices, facilitating seamless connectivity in various network environments. 

High Performance: Optimized for low latency and high throughput. The buffer of the Peer does not need to be reallocated, and kcp shares the buffer.

Ease of Use: Simple API for integrating P2P connectivity into your application.
